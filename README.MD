## Introduction
Whichever hat you wear within the business, we all hope that it runs smoothly 
with no hiccups at all. The application deployed to the production env is stable
 and works without crashing.
Eventually, the application will crash. Components around it upstream and 
downstream will be impacted. It is always good to be prepared for uncertain 
times for bugs that might creep in.<br/>
Logging and monitoring your complete stack is vital. Logging needs to happen at 
every level of the stack, from the infrastructure to the application hosted on 
it.<br/>
Everyone, to name a few, the product owner, developer or infrastructure 
engineer, must give importance to logging.<br/>
[NIST SP800-92](#ref1) defines logs as "a record of the events occurring within 
an organizationâ€™s systems and networks. Logs are composed of log entries; each 
entry contains information related to a specific event that has occurred within 
a system or network."<br/>
Application log entries can be categorized into:<br/>
* Client request and server responses, which can be very helpful in 
  reconstructing sequences of events and determining their apparent outcome. 
* Account information such as successful and failed authentication attempts, 
  account changes (e.g., account creation and deletion, account privilege 
  assignment), and use of privileges.
* Usage information such as the number of transactions occurring in a certain 
  period and the size of transactions.
* Significant operational actions such as application startup and shutdown, 
  application failures, and major application configuration changes. <br/>
The verboseness of log entries needs to be controlled based on the environment 
type. There is no golden rule on the level of details you should log. 
The application log verbosity should be configurable. 
As a rule of thumb, the verboseness 
of an application log should be inversely proportional to the application 
stability. <br/>
